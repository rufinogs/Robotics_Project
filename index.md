## Welcome to my R0b0tic BLOG

I will post my homeworks of Robotic.

### Work Practices

These are my work practices: 

### 1. Follow Line 
The goal is to complete a lap following the line painted on the racing circuit.
We will use <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/ " >JDeRobot</a> with Phyton

<h1>The first implement: <b>The case-based program</b></h1>
It is a conditional control structure that appears in most modern programming languages and allows a selection to be made   between several sets of program statements; the choice is dependent on the value of some expression. The case statement is a  more general structure than the <b> if then else statement </b>,which allows a choice between only two sets of statements.

<h2> The second implement: The PID controller</h2>
The name of PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. These three controllers are combined in such a way that it produces a control signal. As a feedback controller, it delivers the control output at desired levels. I have to admit that with that alteration in my code including the PID controller the Formula one has improve a lot the circulation in the race circuit. For more information you car learn about more of the PID controler in this video I linked:
